# Covid19-Dashboard-Project
At the time this dashboard was made, the condition in Indonesia getting worse again until some of my relatives died because of it. Through exploring this data, I find some interesting insights, good or bad. But one key takeaway for me that **Covid is real** and **stop being careless about health protocol**. I want to say Big Thanks for Alex the Analyst, I made this Dashboard through his series of project portfolio but with some self-exploration.

# The dataset
The dataset is consist of 1 table with many attributes and millions of records in csv format. You can find it on this link below:
https://ourworldindata.org/

# Tools and Steps
Tools I used in this project: PostgreSQL, Spreadsheet, Tableau Public.
Steps:
1. I divided the datasets into two sets, (CovidDeath, CovidVaccine).
2. Then, I make some analysis using PostgreSQL and creating some table for visualizations on Tableau.
3. Finally, start to creating visualization and dashboard on Tableau.
On the visualization I learn to make some action of filter using another chart and it works, but too bad, it worked not the way I want. So, I will try to fix it.

# The Dashboard
